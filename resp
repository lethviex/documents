In the context of DevSecOps support, incidents, service requests, and changes refer to specific aspects of the ongoing management and improvement of the DevSecOps process. Here's an overview of each:

1. Incidents:
In a DevSecOps environment, incidents are unexpected events or issues that impact the normal operation of the development, security, and operations pipeline. These incidents can be related to security breaches, system outages, performance degradation, or any other situation that hinders the continuous integration and deployment process. DevSecOps support teams are responsible for identifying, analyzing, and resolving these incidents swiftly to minimize downtime and ensure the smooth flow of development and deployment.

Examples of incidents in DevSecOps support could include:
- A security vulnerability detected in the codebase that requires immediate attention.
- A build or deployment failure causing a delay in the release cycle.
- A service disruption due to configuration issues in the infrastructure.

2. Service Requests:
Service requests in DevSecOps support are usually predefined tasks or actions that users or teams request from the DevSecOps support team to aid in their development and deployment processes. These requests are typically non-urgent and may involve setting up new development environments, granting access permissions, configuring deployment pipelines, or obtaining support for using specific tools and services.

Examples of service requests in DevSecOps support could include:
- Requesting access to a specific version control repository or cloud infrastructure.
- Seeking assistance in integrating security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Requesting the creation of a new development environment for testing purposes.

3. Changes:
In DevSecOps support, changes refer to planned modifications or enhancements to the existing systems, processes, or infrastructure. These changes are usually implemented to improve the efficiency, security, and reliability of the software delivery pipeline. DevSecOps support teams work closely with development and operations teams to ensure that changes are properly reviewed, tested, and deployed without disrupting the workflow.

Examples of changes in DevSecOps support could include:
- Upgrading a critical component of the CI/CD pipeline to a newer version.
- Implementing a new security policy or access control mechanism.
- Introducing an automated testing framework to improve code quality.

Overall, DevSecOps support plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure, efficient, and continuous software delivery process. They handle incidents to resolve issues promptly, address service requests to provide necessary assistance, and facilitate changes to keep the DevSecOps pipeline up to date and effective.
