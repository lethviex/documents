At present, the application and mission control teams depend on cloud support personnel to obtain critical information, such as impacted virtual machines (VMs), application statuses, and contact details during MC Connect/MI calls. The process of gathering this data is manual and requires accessing multiple portals and running database queries. As a result, there is a significant delay in obtaining the necessary information, which prolongs the time taken to initiate troubleshooting efforts.

Create multiple Grafana dashboards that provide real-time data on applications, VMs, and KVMs hosted in the private cloud. Additionally, develop a dashboard that integrates data from various cloud resources and links it to relevant contact details, offering a unified view for quick access to critical information.
