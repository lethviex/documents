**Disaster Recovery (DR) Runbook for AWS Federated Landing Zone and CI/CD Tools**

## **1. Objective**
This runbook provides a detailed plan for the recovery and continuity of AWS Federated Landing Zone, Control Tower, Account Factory, and CI/CD infrastructure using Harness in the event of a disaster. It ensures minimal downtime, data integrity, and service availability.

## **2. Scope**
- AWS Federated Landing Zone (Control Tower, Account Factory, Identity Federation, Networking, Security Controls)
- CI/CD infrastructure using Harness
- AWS Account Recovery
- Cross-Region and Cross-Account Failover
- Incident Response and Business Continuity Planning
- Security and Compliance Considerations

## **3. Disaster Scenarios**
- **Primary AWS Region Failure** (e.g., widespread AWS outage, regional disaster)
- **Control Tower Service Disruption** (e.g., AWS Control Tower unavailability, misconfigurations)
- **CI/CD Infrastructure Outage** (e.g., Harness platform downtime, pipeline execution failures)
- **Landing Zone IAM Federation Failure** (e.g., identity provider failures, access control misconfigurations)
- **Data Loss or Corruption** (e.g., accidental deletion, ransomware attacks, unauthorized changes)
- **Networking and Connectivity Issues** (e.g., VPC peering failures, Transit Gateway issues, Route 53 failures)

## **4. Recovery Strategy**

### **4.1 AWS Federated Landing Zone**
1. **Control Tower Availability**
   - Ensure AWS Control Tower is deployed in at least two AWS regions.
   - Validate AWS Organizations, AWS IAM Identity Center, and SCP configurations.
   - Utilize AWS Backup for AWS Config, SCPs, and Guardrails.
   - Maintain Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates for quick recovery.

2. **Account Factory Recovery**
   - Ensure backups of AWS Service Catalog configurations.
   - Maintain version-controlled Account Factory pipeline definitions.
   - Validate account provisioning workflows and automation scripts.

3. **IAM Federation Recovery**
   - Validate AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) and Identity Federation settings.
   - Ensure IAM roles, policies, and permission sets are backed up.
   - Restore IAM federation configurations using Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.

4. **Networking & Security Recovery**
   - Ensure VPC, Transit Gateway, and Direct Connect configurations are backed up.
   - Use AWS Firewall Manager and Security Hub to validate compliance.
   - Restore AWS Config rules and security controls from backup.
   
### **4.2 CI/CD Infrastructure using Harness**
1. **Harness Platform Recovery**
   - Deploy Harness in a multi-region active-passive setup.
   - Ensure Harness database backups are stored securely in S3 with versioning.
   - Validate connectivity with AWS accounts and ensure OAuth integrations are functional.

2. **Pipeline and Deployment Recovery**
   - Maintain version-controlled pipeline definitions in Git repositories.
   - Ensure application artifacts are stored in AWS S3, ECR, or Nexus with cross-region replication.
   - Restore pipeline configurations using Helm charts, Terraform, or CloudFormation.

3. **Artifact & Environment Availability**
   - Validate backup copies of application artifacts and Helm charts.
   - Ensure EKS, ECS, or EC2 instances are redeployed in the DR region.
   - Restore Terraform or CloudFormation stacks for infrastructure as code (IaC).

### **4.3 Cross-Region and Cross-Account Failover**
1. **AWS Route 53 for DNS Failover**
   - Configure Route 53 health checks and failover routing policies.
   - Ensure domain failover strategies are tested regularly.

2. **AWS Transit Gateway for Inter-Region Connectivity**
   - Establish automated failover for inter-region networking.
   - Validate AWS Direct Connect resilience and VPC peering failover.

3. **Multi-Region Replication for Critical Resources**
   - Enable cross-region replication for S3, RDS, DynamoDB, and ECR.
   - Implement AWS Backup and AWS DataSync for automated backups.
   - Ensure AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and event-driven workflows are resilient.

4. **Failover Testing and DR Drills**
   - Conduct regular failover tests and document recovery metrics.
   - Automate failover testing using AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS).

## **5. Incident Response Plan**
1. **Detection and Identification**
   - Use AWS CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and Security Hub to detect failures.
   - Automate alerting via AWS SNS and PagerDuty.

2. **Containment and Mitigation**
   - Follow AWS Security Incident Response playbooks.
   - Implement WAF rules and IAM policy changes to mitigate threats.

3. **Recovery and Restoration**
   - Follow predefined recovery procedures for Landing Zone and CI/CD tools.
   - Validate infrastructure, applications, and security controls post-recovery.

4. **Post-Incident Review and Improvements**
   - Conduct RCA (Root Cause Analysis) and update documentation.
   - Improve automation and monitoring based on incident learnings.

## **6. Communication and Escalation Plan**
- **Primary Contacts:** AWS Support, CloudOps, DevOps, Security teams.
- **Escalation Process:** Internal escalation matrix for critical failures.
- **Stakeholder Notification:** Regular updates via Slack, email, or ITSM tools.
- **AWS Support Engagement:** Engage AWS TAM and Enterprise Support when required.

## **7. Compliance and Governance Considerations**
- Ensure DR plans align with regulatory requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.).
- Maintain audit logs and evidence for DR drills.
- Validate IAM roles and SCPs for security and compliance adherence.

## **8. Conclusion**
This DR runbook ensures resilience, high availability, and business continuity for AWS Federated Landing Zone and CI/CD infrastructure using Harness. Regular testing, automation, and documentation updates will maintain an effective DR strategy.
