- [ ] **DR Plan Testing:** Test the Disaster Recovery (DR) procedures, including failover and data restoration.  
- [ ] **Data Integrity Checks:** Perform data integrity checks to ensure data consistency after go-live.  

---

## **5. Security and Compliance**  
- [ ] **SCPs and Guardrails:** Validate that Service Control Policies (SCPs) and Control Tower guardrails are enforced.  
- [ ] **MFA and Access Audits:** Confirm MFA is enforced for all privileged accounts and perform an access audit.

---

## **6. Automation and CI/CD Pipelines**  
- [ ] **CI/CD Validation:** Verify that CI/CD pipelines are integrated for infrastructure as code and application deployments.  
- [ ] **IaC Testing:** Confirm that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates (e.g., CloudFormation/Terraform) are tested and version-controlled.  
- [ ] **Automated Remediation:** Ensure automated remediation scripts are configured for security and operational incidents.  

---

## **7. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**  
- [ ] **Handover Documentation:** Confirm receipt of comprehensive documentation, including:  
  - Architecture diagrams and deployment designs.  
  - Operational runbooks and incident response procedures.  
  - Access control and IAM role mappings.  
- [ ] **Knowledge Transfer Sessions:** Attend knowledge transfer sessions from the professional services team.  
- [ ] **Runbooks Review:** Review and update operational runbooks for incident management and standard operating procedures.  

---

## **8. Operational Readiness**  
- [ ] **Incident Response Playbooks:** Verify incident response playbooks are documented and accessible.  
- [ ] **Escalation Matrix:** Confirm the escalation matrix is defined and shared with all team members.  
- [ ] **On-Call Rotation:** Establish and communicate on-call schedules for post-go-live support.  

---

## **9. Testing and Validation**  
- [ ] **UAT Completion:** Ensure User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is completed, and sign-off is obtained from stakeholders.  
- [ ] **Security Testing:** Perform final security testing, including vulnerability scans and penetration tests.  
- [ ] **Performance Testing:** Validate system performance under expected load conditions.  
- [ ] **Failover Testing:** Confirm failover and high availability configurations are tested and functional.  

---

## **10. Go-Live Execution**  
- [ ] **Go-Live Command Center:** Set up a virtual or physical command center for real-time monitoring and incident handling.  
- [ ] **Stakeholder Communication:** Provide real-time updates to stakeholders during the go-live event.  
- [ ] **Health Checks:** Perform system health checks post-go-live to confirm all services are operational.  
- [ ] **Issue Tracking:** Document and track all issues encountered during go-live with a clear action plan.  

---

## **11. Post-Go-Live Support and Hypercare**  
- [ ] **Hypercare Support:** Arrange a hypercare period with enhanced support and monitoring.  
- [ ] **Post-Go-Live Review:** Conduct a post-go-live review to identify lessons learned and improvement areas.  
- [ ] **Incident Review:** Analyze and document any incidents or issues encountered during go-live.  
- [ ] **Sign-Off:** Obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders confirming successful go-live and operational readiness.
