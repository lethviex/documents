| **Capacity Management** | Plan and manage cloud infrastructure capacity to meet current and future demands, avoiding over-provisioning or under-provisioning. |
| **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** | Define and maintain SLOs for cloud services, measuring their performance against these objectives and working to meet or exceed them. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Identify opportunities for process improvements, automation, and enhanced reliability. Participate in retrospectives and implement actions to prevent recurring issues. |
| **Vendor and Tool Evaluation** | Research and evaluate cloud service providers, tools, and technologies to optimize the cloud environment and improve processes. |

It's important to note that the exact responsibilities may differ between organizations, and some tasks might be shared with other teams, such as development or operations. The SRE role emphasizes collaboration between development and operations, ensuring a holistic approach to supporting and maintaining cloud services.
