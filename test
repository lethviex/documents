Certainly, here's a summarized document outlining the main steps and purpose of your Python script:

---

**Script Purpose**: This Python script is designed to gather information from various sources related to VMware environments, both on VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS and traditional vCenter setups. The goal is to analyze VM data and cluster capacity to determine whether additional resources are needed for a VMware infrastructure.

**Flowchart Summary**:

1. **Connect to VMC on AWS Console**
   - Purpose: Collect SDDC and Cluster availability zone details from VMC on AWS.
   - Check for a successful connection, and if unsuccessful, the script ends with an error message.

2. **Connect to Brownfield vCenter**
   - Purpose: Gather VM information from an existing (Brownfield) vCenter environment using the pyvmomi Python module.
   - Verify the connection's success; if not successful, the script terminates with an error message.

3. **Connect to Greenfield vCenter**
   - Purpose: Collect cluster capacity details from a new (Greenfield) vCenter environment using the pyvmomi Python module.
   - Check if the connection to the Greenfield vCenter is successful; if not, the script terminates with an error message.

4. **Calculate Capacity Requirement**
   - Purpose: Analyze the collected VM information from the Brownfield vCenter to determine the capacity requirements.

5. **Compare Capacity Availability**
   - Purpose: Compare the calculated capacity requirement with the actual capacity available in the Greenfield vCenter.
   - If capacity is insufficient, the script proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it concludes that no additional resources are required.

6. **Suggest Node Addition Required**
   - Purpose: If capacity is insufficient, this step suggests the need to add nodes or resources to the Greenfield vCenter environment to meet the capacity requirements.

7. **End**
   - The script concludes its execution.

This flowchart provides an overview of the script's logic, including key steps for connecting to different VMware environments, collecting data, and making capacity-related decisions.
