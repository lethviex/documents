   - Leverage metadata to provide additional context about the images stored in ECR.

8. **Monitoring Image Sizes and Push Frequency:**
   - Monitor the size of container images to control storage costs.
   - Keep track of image push frequency to identify unusual activity or potential security issues.

9. **Compliance and Governance:**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant regulatory requirements and industry standards.
   - Implement auditing and logging mechanisms to maintain governance and accountability.

10. **Documentation and Training:**
    - Document ECR configurations, policies, and procedures for reference.
    - Provide training to relevant team members on ECR best practices and security guidelines.

11. **Cost Optimization:**
    - Use AWS Cost Explorer and other cost management tools to optimize ECR-related expenses.
    - Consider lifecycle policies to move older images to lower-cost storage tiers or delete unused images.

Remember that this checklist provides a minimum viable foundation for ECR operations support readiness. Depending on your organization's specific needs and compliance requirements, you may need to expand and customize this checklist further. Regularly review and update the checklist as your container image registry usage evolves.
