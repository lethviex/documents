Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of the **Operations Tasks** with integrated **DevOps CI/CD** responsibilities under each ITIL process category:  

---

### **Incident Management**  
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline failures using AWS CloudWatch and third-party tools (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus).  
- Automate incident notifications through AWS SNS integrated with Slack/Teams.  
- Quickly identify and remediate build/deployment failures in CI/CD workflows.  
- Roll back failed deployments using automated rollback strategies in CI/CD pipelines.  
- Perform post-incident reviews and update CI/CD processes to prevent recurrence.  
- Implement self-healing mechanisms using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch alarms.  

---

### **Service Request Management**  
- Automate environment provisioning (Dev, QA, Prod) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.  
- Implement self-service deployment pipelines through AWS Service Catalog.  
- Manage access requests for CI/CD tools and repositories using AWS IAM roles and permissions boundaries.  
- Facilitate service requests for new CI/CD pipeline creation and updates.  
- Automate software delivery workflows using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild.  

---

### **Change Management**  
- Automate code deployment approvals through gated CI/CD pipeline stages.  
- Implement blue/green or canary deployments in AWS to minimize risk.  
- Enforce change policies using Git workflows (e.g., pull requests, branch protection rules).  
- Utilize feature flags to deploy code changes safely without impacting production.  
- Maintain audit trails of code changes via version control (e.g., Git) and AWS Config.  
- Integrate automated testing in CI/CD pipelines to validate changes before deployment.  

---

### **Problem Management**  
- Analyze recurring pipeline failures to identify systemic problems.  
- Implement automated testing and static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube) to detect code-level issues early.  
- Use AWS CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray for debugging complex deployment issues.  
- Document known pipeline issues and resolutions in the knowledge base.  
- Implement proactive monitoring of CI/CD systems to prevent downtime.  

---

### **Capacity Management**  
- Monitor build server and runner capacity (e.g., AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins agents) to optimize resource allocation.  
- Scale CI/CD infrastructure dynamically using AWS Auto Scaling Groups or Kubernetes.  
- Optimize pipeline execution times by parallelizing tasks and caching dependencies.  
- Forecast resource requirements for large-scale deployments.  
- Review and adjust build environments for cost efficiency using spot instances.  

---

### **Patch Management**  
- Automate patching of build servers and CI/CD infrastructure using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.  
- Integrate vulnerability scanning (e.g., AWS Inspector, Snyk) into CI/CD pipelines.  
- Regularly update CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab) to the latest secure versions.  
- Deploy patches to container images using automated pipeline steps.  
- Enforce automated security checks for dependencies and libraries during builds.
