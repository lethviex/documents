Nonfunctional requirements, also known as quality attributes or system qualities, define the characteristics and constraints that the application must adhere to in order to meet the desired performance, security, and usability standards. When hosting an application in VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC), the following nonfunctional requirements should be considered:

1. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - Response Time: Specify the maximum acceptable response time for critical operations to ensure the application is responsive and performs well.
   - Throughput: Define the number of concurrent users or transactions the system should handle efficiently.
   - Scalability: Describe how the application should scale in response to increased workload or user demands, both vertically (adding resources to a single instance) and horizontally (adding more instances).

2. **Availability and Reliability:**
   - Uptime and Downtime: Specify the minimum required uptime (e.g., 99.99%) and allowable downtime for maintenance and updates.
   - Failover and Redundancy: Define the mechanisms for handling failures and ensuring high availability, including failover strategies and data redundancy.

3. **Security:**
   - Authentication and Authorization: Define the authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, SAML, etc.) and authorization rules to control access to the application and its resources.
   - Data Security: Specify the encryption standards and protocols for data at rest and data in transit to safeguard sensitive information.
   - Auditability: Define the requirement for audit logs to track and monitor user activities and system changes.

4. **Compliance:**
   - Regulatory Compliance: Identify any specific regulations or standards that the application must comply with (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.).
   - VMC Best Practices: Ensure adherence to VMware Cloud on AWS best practices and guidelines for security, networking, and performance.

5. **Scalability and Resource Management:**
   - Resource Utilization: Define acceptable thresholds for CPU, memory, and storage usage to optimize resource allocation and avoid performance bottlenecks.
   - Auto-scaling: Specify the conditions under which the application should automatically scale up or down based on demand.

6. **Maintainability and Manageability:**
   - Logging and Monitoring: Specify the logging and monitoring requirements to aid in debugging, troubleshooting, and performance analysis.
   - Error Handling: Define the approach for handling errors and exceptions to ensure graceful degradation and improved user experience.

7. **Usability and User Experience:**
   - Accessibility: Specify accessibility standards to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
   - User Interface Guidelines: Define user interface design principles and guidelines for consistency and ease of use.

8. **Integration and Interoperability:**
   - API Requirements: Specify the API standards and formats for integration with other systems or third-party applications.
   - Data Exchange Formats: Define the acceptable data exchange formats to facilitate interoperability.

9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Backup Policy: Define the frequency and retention period for backups, as well as the backup storage location.
   - Disaster Recovery Plan: Specify the procedures and protocols for recovering the application and data in case of a catastrophic event.

10. **Cost Constraints:**
    - Resource Optimization: Define cost-saving measures, such as optimizing resource usage and using reserved instances when appropriate.

Remember that nonfunctional requirements are just as important as functional requirements, as they directly impact the overall performance, security, and usability of the application. These requirements need to be well-defined, measurable, and testable to ensure the successful deployment and operation of the application on VMC on AWS.
