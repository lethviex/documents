Please note that the criticality of metrics may vary depending on your specific application and business requirements. It's important to configure alerting thresholds based on your organization's needs and priorities. Additionally, both AWS and Azure offer native monitoring solutions like CloudWatch and Azure Monitor, which can help you collect and visualize these metrics and set up alerts as needed.
