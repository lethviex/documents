"We currently have a set of standard Minimum Viable Operations (MVO) outlined in our JIRA system for AWS Cloud native operations. I kindly request your thorough review of the existing MVO and suggest any necessary enhancements or modifications to tasks that are pivotal for taking over cloud-native support. Attached, you will find the relevant JIRA tasks. Once you've made the updates, please share them, and I will take care of importing them into JIRA."
