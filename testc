### **FinOps Team - Roles and Responsibilities**

#### **Primary Role**: Optimize cloud costs while balancing performance and functionality.  
#### **Key Responsibilities**:
1. **Cost Management and Reporting**:
   - Monitor cloud spend across all teams and provide insights to reduce waste.
   - Generate periodic financial reports and analysis for stakeholders.
   - Define tagging and tracking policies for accurate cost attribution.

2. **Budgeting and Forecasting**:
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to forecast cloud expenditure based on usage patterns.
   - Ensure adherence to allocated budgets while maintaining required performance.

3. **Optimization Recommendations**:
   - Provide guidance on rightsizing resources (e.g., compute, storage).
   - Identify and recommend changes to reduce over-provisioning or underutilization.
   - Suggest changes in pricing models (e.g., reserved instances, spot instances).

4. **Spend Monitoring**:
   - Continuously track real-time cloud expenses against budgets.
   - Highlight cost anomalies or unexpected spikes to relevant teams.

5. **Collaboration and Governance**:
   - Work closely with engineering, application, and operations teams to implement cost-saving measures.
   - Develop policies for efficient and transparent cloud spending.
   - Train teams on cost management best practices and tools.
