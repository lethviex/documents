Certainly, here's a sample transcript for the feedback conversation with Jenna:

**You:** Jenna, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I want to start by saying how much I appreciate your dedication, passion, and the exceptional work you've done over the past two years at the organization, especially during these challenging times as we approach the end of the quarter. Your contributions have been invaluable.

**Jenna:** Thank you, I really enjoy being part of this team.

**You:** I wanted to have this conversation today because there have been a few instances where your communication style has had an impact on your colleagues. Specifically, I observed in our recent team meeting that you raised your voice while discussing an issue with Lee, and it seemed to leave him feeling dismissed and embarrassed. I've also received feedback from other team members who mentioned feeling like their input is sometimes disregarded by you.

**Jenna:** I see what you're saying, and I didn't mean to come across that way. It's been stressful lately, and I guess I let my frustration show.

**You:** I understand that we're all under a lot of pressure, and it's okay to feel stressed at times. I want to emphasize that we value your input and your passion for the work. However, it's essential that our team maintains a positive and respectful environment. When we communicate in a way that makes others feel dismissed or embarrassed, it can affect team dynamics and overall performance.

**Jenna:** I didn't realize it was having such an impact. I'll work on it.

**You:** That's great to hear, Jenna. I'd like to hear your perspective on these situations. What were your thoughts and feelings during those moments, and is there anything specific that might have triggered your response?

**Jenna:** Well, I was frustrated because I felt like we were running out of time, and I wanted to make sure our team addressed the issue properly. But I can see now that I could have handled it better.

**You:** Thank you for sharing that. It's important for us to understand each other's viewpoints. Moving forward, I believe we can find a way to address these situations constructively. How do you think we can improve our communication within the team, especially during stressful times?

**Jenna:** Maybe we can have more structured discussions, where everyone gets a chance to speak without interruptions. And I'll work on staying calm and not raising my voice, even when things get tough.

**You:** Those are excellent suggestions, Jenna. Let's implement those changes and check in regularly to see how things are progressing. I'm here to support you in making these improvements, and I'm confident that, together, we can create a more positive and productive team environment.

**Jenna:** Thank you for your understanding and support. I'm committed to making these changes.

**You:** I appreciate your willingness to work on this, Jenna. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting in a few weeks to discuss your progress and any additional support you might need. And remember, if you ever have concerns or need assistance, my door is always open.

In this sample conversation, the feedback is delivered in a constructive and empathetic manner, with a focus on collaboration and improvement.
