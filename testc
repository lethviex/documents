### **Harness CI/CD Overview**

1. **Introduction to Harness CI/CD**
   - **Harness CI/CD** is a modern DevOps platform that automates software delivery and infrastructure changes across cloud and on-premises environments.
   - **Objective**: Enable faster, more reliable releases with automated processes, improving developer productivity and deployment quality.

2. **Key Components**
   - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automates the process of building, testing, and verifying code to ensure each change is production-ready.
   - **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automates the deployment of applications to production and non-production environments.

3. **Main Features**
   - **Automated Builds**: Efficiently trigger builds, run tests, and generate artifacts.
   - **Pipeline Orchestration**: Flexible pipeline setup with prebuilt steps and approval gates.
   - **Approval Gates and Rollbacks**: Enforce approvals, automate rollback strategies to handle failures.
   - **Environment Management**: Seamlessly manage multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructure.
   - **Built-in Security**: Integrate security checks throughout the CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and manage costs, especially in cloud environments.

4. **Benefits**
   - **Speed**: Faster development and release cycles.
   - **Reliability**: Consistent and secure delivery processes.
   - **Scalability**: Easily supports scaling across various cloud providers.
   - **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized resource usage with built-in insights.

For visual representation:
- Use icons to represent CI, CD, cloud integration, approval gates, and security.
- Use a flow diagram to illustrate the CI/CD pipeline, highlighting stages like Build, Test, Deploy, and Monitor.
