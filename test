Write a CICD infrastructure summary in five lines, we have Self service portal, Git, Jfrog, Jenkins, Blackduck, AWS Cloudformation

AWS CICD infrastructure is driven by a self-service portal for streamlined user interaction, Git serves as the version control system, managing code repositories. JFrog facilitates artifact management, ensuring efficient storage and distribution of build artifacts. Jenkins orchestrates continuous integration, automating the testing and building processes. Blackduck integrates seamlessly for security scanning, identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. AWS CloudFormation plays a pivotal role in automating infrastructure provisioning, allowing for consistent and reproducible deployments across our AWS environment. Together, these components form a robust pipeline, promoting collaboration, automation, and security in our software development lifecycle.
